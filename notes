To do
    move to port of Adafruit library instead
    better amplification on sound
    connect Lite and allow turning off backlight and turning off TFT
    implement entering low-power mode
    make sure all transitions and events are valid or noted to do nothing
        short 1, short 2, short 1+2, long 1, long 2, long 1+2

If the handle event callback is exited and no timers and no clips
  are running, enter low-power mode and kill screen
interrupt on button push -> wake from sleep so main() can run

Waiting
    short 1 or 2 -> start timer
    short 1+2 -> status
    long 1 -> edit starting with timer 1
    long 2 -> edit starting with timer 2
    long 1+2 -> sleep
Edit
    short 1 -> add
    short 2 -> subtract
    short 1+2 -> cancel -> waiting
    long 1 or 2 -> start
    long 1+2 -> cancel -> sleep
Status
    any -> Waiting
Running
    short 1 or 2 -> go to Paused
    long 1 or 2 -> cancel, go to Waiting
    short 1+2
    long 1+2 -> sleep
Paused
    short 1 or 2 or 1+2 -> resume Running
    long 1 or 2 -> cancel, go to Waiting
    long 1+2 -> sleep
Alarm
    short 1 or 2 -> return to Waiting
    short 1+2 -> return to Waiting
    long 1 or 2 -> start timer 1 or 2
    long 1+2 -> sleep

It turns out that the DMA destination size must be set to WORD.
