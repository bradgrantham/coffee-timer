To do
    move to port of Adafruit library instead
    better amplification on sound
    connect Lite and allow turning off backlight and turning off TFT
    implement entering low-power mode

If the handle event callback is exited and no timers and no clips
  are running, enter low-power mode (kill screen?)
interrupt on button push -> wake from sleep so main() can run

verify button can wake board

serial /dev/tty.usbmodem14103 115200 # in other window

cd build

# st-flash read old.stm32g4.firmware.bin 0x8000000 128k # only need once
st-flash write build/coffee-timer.bin 0x8000000

It turns out that the DMA destination size must be set to WORD.
