To do
    move to port of Adafruit library instead
    rotate 270 degrees
    better amplification
    connect Lite and allow turning off backlight and turning off TFT

If the handle event callback is exited and no timers and no clips
  are running, enter low-power mode (kill screen?)
interrupt on button push -> wake from sleep so main() can run

serial /dev/tty.usbmodem14103 115200 # in other window

cd build
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/packages/gcc-arm-none-eabi-7-2018-q2-update/bin/ make -j1
# st-flash read old.stm32g4.firmware.bin 0x8000000 128k # only need once
st-flash write build/coffee-timer.bin 0x8000000

have some kind of time measurement in main loop
Timer stuff, but print in main instead of graphics
audio bits
graphics to TFT - screen off, PWM
sleep if event queue drained when exiting event handler (timeout screen?)
verify button can wake board

It turns out that the destination size must be set to WORD.
